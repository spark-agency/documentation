## Development with Toddle
Development with toddle is nice.

![Toddle in Context](https://images.ctfassets.net/lizv2opdd3ay/6FCBNbwjzzmeRDrXTb7jcr/efecbf8c44360ebdaf677561f9fd8fbd/create_a_project.webp)

Toddle is a very lightweight framework that bases on vanilla JavaScript. The runtime only has around 30 kb.
