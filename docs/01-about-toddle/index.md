# About Toddle
It is hard to define what exactly toddle is. It is a versatile platform, an editor, a framework. A little backend.

## Traditional Development
Traditional dev is time-consuming.

This is just a tip that *emphasized words* can include more context. It supports **most** styling options like [links](https://www.example.com). This sentence has `inline code` in it.

Here's a different callout. The callout can also contain [links](https://toodle.dev). You can place headings in here, but you really should not. A callout is for a small nugget of information. This sentence has `inline code` in it.

## Development with Toddle
Development with toddle is nice.

Toddle is a very lightweight framework that bases on vanilla JavaScript. The runtime only has around 30 kb.

## Comparison to No Code Tools
No Code has more abstraction. Hit [kbd]A[kbd] to access the AI assistant. You can also use [kbd]CMD[kbd] + [kbd]K[kbd], but this will do nothing.
